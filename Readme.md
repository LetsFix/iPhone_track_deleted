## Welcome to iPhone_Track_Deleted
 Apple keeps track of applications that you have purchased.<br>
 However, if you recently deleted one or many applications<br>
 the only way to find them is by scrolling down or searching purchased with the "application name"

## Features: Chronological, Links, Usability
 1) Chronological storage of previously deleted applications.
 2) Each element on the list is a link to its location on the appstore allowing quick re-download.


:smile: the only challenge in using this application is re-downloading this application when deleted. :smile::smile::laughing:
